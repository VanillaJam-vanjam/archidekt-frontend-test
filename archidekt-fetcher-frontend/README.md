# My test for server/client based webpage generation

This React project aims to connect to a local Koa server and use its compiled json to generate a list of my saved decks in Archidekt

**[Server project link](https://github.com/VanillaJam-vanjam/archidekt-backend-test)** 

## How it's made

**Tech used:** JavaScript, JSX, React, Koa

This project was used out of my newfound passion to create automation based on websites' generated API data. Combined with my other passion with MTG and card games in general, I created this project as a tutorial for myself to understand full-stack development.

## Lessons learned:

The first thing that came up is that juggling and compiling json-files is quite easy. So are client-server connections as well. This project also taught me much about the basics of React, Javascript and dividing code into components for readability.
